# Universal Robots UR3e 3-Multi Tool Station

## Overview
This project showcases a **custom 3-tool system** (screwdriver, wrench, and gripper) designed for the **Universal Robot UR3e**. The system enables the robot to switch tools seamlessly across different workstations, optimizing automation processes.

## Features
- **3D-printed custom tool system** for quick tool switching.
- **Pre-programmed movement paths** for efficient task execution.
- **Designed for automation** in assembly and maintenance tasks.

## 3D Model & Workstations
Images of the **3D model and workstations** will be added here:
